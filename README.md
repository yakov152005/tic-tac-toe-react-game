# Tic Tac Toe React Game

A simple two-player Tic Tac Toe game built with React. Players enter their names and take turns marking X or O on a 3Ã—3 grid. The game highlights the winning line, tracks how long the match lasted, and lets you restart at any time.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

3. Run tests:

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

4. Create a production build:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Gameplay

- Enter names for Player 1 and Player 2 when prompted.
- Players alternate clicking squares to place their mark.
- The first player to align three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.
- Use the **Restart** button to start a new match.
